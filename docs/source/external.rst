Note that Explore is available for graduate students and is suitable for
graduate projects, benchmarking, code development and porting, similar small-scale uses.
This can be up to 400,000 credits.

NCAR https://arc.ucar.edu/xras_submit/opportunities

   - Small allocation: U.S. university researchers who are supported by an NSF award can request an initial small allocation of up to 400,000 core-hours on Cheyenne. These allocations can be used to complete small projects or to conduct initial runs in preparation for submitting a request for a large allocation.

   - Exploratory: A graduate student, post-doctoral researcher, or new faculty member at a U.S. university can request a one-time allocation of up to 400,000 Cheyenne core-hours. These awards typically support dissertations, help foster early career research, or provide seed resources for pursuing funded research. An individual can request a new exploratory project at each stage of their career path. A new faculty member is any eligible researcher who has not previously had an NCAR allocation as a faculty member

NCSA https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/about/illinois-computes/

The National Center for Supercomputing Applications supports Illinois researchers through Illinois
Computes, a program offering computing and data storage resources, technical expertise and support
services to researchers from domains across campus. They can cover a broad range of computing needs.

Data storage
------------

Often publications require public availability of data and code. This requirement can be 
met with the Illinois Data Bank. The Illinois Data Bank is a public access repository for
publishing research data from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

https://databank.illinois.edu/

The data bank provides a place to store published data:
  - that is open to anyone in the world.
  - receives a stable identifier (DOI) for easy reference and citation.
  - is readily available for anyone to access for a minimum of 5 years.
  - is located in a stable environment that complies with many funder and publisher requirements.
